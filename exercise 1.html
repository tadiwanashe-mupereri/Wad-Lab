<h2><b>Family law</b></h2>
<p style="background-color:blue;">Family law varies from culture to culture, but in its broadest application it defines the legal relationships 
among family members as well as the relationships between families and society at large.
 Some of the important questions dealt with in family law include the terms and parameters of marriage, the status
 of children, and the succession of property from one generation to the next. 
In nearly every case, family law represents a delicate balance between the interests of society and the protection of
 individual rights.</p>

<p style="background-color:yellow;">The general rule in marriages until modern times was the legal transfer of dependency, that of the bride, from father to groom.
 Not only did the groom assume guardianship, he usually assumed control over all of his wife’s affairs.
 Often, the woman lost any legal identity through marriage, as was the case in English common law.
 There have been exceptions to this practice. Muslim women, for instance, had considerable control over their own personal property. 
The use of dowries, an amount of money or property given to the husband with the bride in compensation for her dependency,
 has long been practiced in many countries, but it has tended to disappear in many industrial societies.</p>

<p style="color:white;">In general, modern marriage is best-described as a voluntary union, usually between a man and a woman
 (although there are still vestiges of the arranged marriage that once flourished in eastern Europe and Asia).
 The emancipation of women in the 19th and 20th centuries changed marriage dramatically, particularly in connection
 with property and economic status. By the mid-20th century, most Western countries had enacted legislation establishing 
equality between spouses.</p>
 <p style="background-color:purple;">Similarly changed is the concept of economic maintenance,
 which traditionally fell on the shoulders of the husband. Though many laws still lean toward this view, 
there was increasing recognition of a woman’s potential to contribute to the support of the family.
 At the beginning of the 21st century, family law and the notion of family itself was further complicated
 by calls for acceptance of same-sex marriages and nontraditional families.</p>

<p style="color:blue;"><em>Dissolution of marriages is one of the areas in which laws must try to balance private</em>and public interest,
 since realistically it is the couple itself that can best decide whether its marriage is viable.
 In many older systems—e.g., Roman, Muslim, Jewish, Chinese, and Japanese—some form of unilateral divorce was possible,
 requiring only one party to give notice of the intention, usually the male. Most modern systems recognize a mutual request for divorce, 
though many require an attempt to reconcile before granting divorce. Extreme circumstances, in which blatant neglect, abuse, misbehaviour,
 or incapacity can be demonstrated, find resolution in civil court. Many systems favour special family courts that attempt to deal more
 fairly with sensitive issues such as custody of children.</p>

ss<p>The issue of children poses special problems for family law. In nearly every culture, the welfare of children was formerly left to 
the parents entirely, and this usually meant the father. Most societies have come to recognize the general benefit of protecting 
children’s rights and of prescribing certain standards of rearing. Thus, more than in any other area, family law intervenes in private
 lives with regard to children. Compulsory education is an example of the law superseding parental authority. 
In the case of single-parent homes, the law will frequently provide some form of support. Legislation on child labour and child
 abuse also asserts society’s responsibility for a child’s best interests.</p>
